For this project, because of it is a web app mostly about the view, we are doing mostly the integration testing from a user's perspective.
Not only we test our own code, we test code written by other teammates so we can find more issues in our implementation and provide suggestion to the team.
We have also done some extreme test like trying to delete a song added by other user or trying to book a seat for a person that is not related to you.
